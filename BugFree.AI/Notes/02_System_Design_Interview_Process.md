# System Design Interview Process 
## Overview 
The system design interview is often one of the most challenging aaa parts of the software engineering interview process, especially at larger tech companies. It is designed to assess your ability to think architecturally, handle large-scale systems, and balance trade-offs between multiple competing requirements. In this section, you'll learn about the components of a system design interview, how your performance will be judged, and what to expect during the interview.

## Components of the System Design Interview Process 
A typical system design interview is structured into several core phases. Here's what you can expect during the interview:

### Understanding the Problem
- **Clarify requirements**: You will start by asking questions to clarify the problem. Make sure to understand both the functional requirements (what the system needs to do) and non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, etc.).

- **Defining scope**: Clearly define what part of the system you're going to design, setting appropriate boundaries. Sometimes, interviewers will give ambiguous or incomplete requirements to see if you ask the right questions. 

### High-level System Design 
- **Breaking down components**: At this stage, you'll outline the major components of the system (e.g., front-end, backend, database, caching, etc.).
- **Data Flow**: Show how data moves through the system from one component to the next. 
- **Scalability considerations**: Think about how to handle increased traffic or data, disucssing scaling methods (horizontal vs. vertical).

### Detailed Component Design
- **Design key components**: Now, you will dive deeper into individual components such as databases, APIs, load balancers, or caches. 
- **Data modeling**: Depending on the system, you might need to discuss database schema, data partitioning (sharding), or replication strategies. 
- **Handling bottlenecks**: Address potential bottlenecks and how to resolve them (e.g., using queues, optimizing read/write performance).

### Trade-offs and Alternatives 
- **Evaluating trade-offs**: System design often involves making trade-offs between competing requirements, such as consistency vs. availability, latency vs. throughput, or cost vs. performance. Explain the trade-offs you're making and justify your decisions. 
- **Disucssion alternatives**: You should also mention alternative design approaches, showing that you've considered multiple options before making your final decision. 


### Scaling the System (considering distributed env problems & deployments)
- **Scaling horizontal or vertically**: Discuss how your system would scale as the number of users or data increases. 
- **Dealing with failures**: Explain how your system can handle failures, such as server downtime or network issues. 
- **Global distribution**: For large-scale systems, you may need to consider how to distribute your system across mulitple geographic regions. 

### Handling Edge Cases and Failures 
- **Identifying edge cases**: Consider and design for edge cases such as high traffic spikes, unusual user behavior, or system crashes.
