# Traffic Estimation and Calculation 

Once functional and non-functional requirements are defined, the next critical step in the system design process is **Traffic Estimation and Calculation**. This step helps us estimate how much traffic our system will handle, how much data will flow through it, and what resources are needed to support it. Accurate traffic estimation is key to designing a system that scales effectively and performs well under both normal and peak conditions. 

In system design interviews, discussing traffic estimation shows that you can plan for capacity and avoid bottlenecks. In this section, we will learn how to calculate expected traffic, estimate resource requirements, and design for scalability, using the URL Shortening Service as our running example.

## Why Traffic Estimation is Important 
Traffic estimation helps us: 

- Determine system capacity: Estimate how many requests per second (RPS) our system needs to handle. 
- Plan for scaling: Understand the load on databases, networks, and servers, and plan for horizontal or vertical scaling. 
- Identify bottlenecks: Determine which parts of the system may become overloaded under heavy traffic.
- Optimize performance: Estimate storage and bandwidth needs to optimize for cost, performance, and reliability.
Accurately estimating traffic ensures our system can handle both normal daily load and sudden spikes in usage without breaking down or becoming sluggish.

## Steps for Traffic Estimation 
### Understand Key Metrics 
Start by understanding the key metrics you'll need to estimate traffic: 

- Request per second (RPS): The number of requests the system handles per second. 
- Storage size: The amount of data that needs to be stored, including user data, logs, etc.
- Read/Write ratio: The proportion of read operations (e.g., retrieving data) versus write operations (e.g., creating new data).
- Peak vs average traffic: Systems typically see peak traffic during certain times (e.g., a sale or viral content), so you should estimate for both average and peak traffic.

## Best Practice for API Design 
- Consistency Key: Ensure that naming conventions, response formats, and error codes are consistent across your APIs. This improves maintainability and makes the API easier to use for developers. 
- Optimize for Performance: Use caching for frequencyly requested data (e.g., redirecting short URLs) to improve performance. For example, caching the short URL redirection in Redis can reduce database load. 
- Consider Security: Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse , **authenticaion** (e.g., OAuth or API keys) for sensitive operations like managing URLs, and encryption (e.g., HTTPs) to secure data in transit. 
- Documentation: Well-documented APIs are easier to use and maintain. Tools like Swagger can help us generate interactive API documentation.
- Throttling and Rate Limiting: Use throttling to avoid system overload during traffic spikes. For instance, limit how many URL shortening requests a user can make per minute.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid 
- Ignoring pagination: For APIs that return large dataseets, not implementing pagination can lead to performance bottlencks. 
- Inconsistent naming: Inconsistent API naming and structure can make the API confusing for clients. 
- Lack of clear versioning: Failing to version your APIs can cause problems when you need to make breaking changes in the future. 
- Overcomplicating the API: keep the API simple and focused. Don't expose unnecessary internal details of your system.
