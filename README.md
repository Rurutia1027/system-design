# System Design 

Most of the questions in this repo are derived form the [Exponent System Design Interview Course](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/system-design-interviews?src=nav). 

For each question, the answer is based primarily on Exponent's video explanation. In addition, we add: 
- Interviewer's guiding questions (as heard or inferred from the video),
- Follow-up questions that should have been asked or answered.
- Key points that were missed by the interviewee but should be mentioned during a real system design interview.

There are a number of important concepts referenced throughout this repo. Most of them come from:
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA).
- System Design Interview by Alex Xu,
- And the Exponent video course itself.

You'll also find notes about how interviewers evaluate candiates, such as the criteria for "weak hire", "strong hire", and so on -- these are especially helpful self-evaluation and identifying what to improve. 

We also provide scripts or structured answers to classic system design questions from Exponents, categorized by topic:

- Real-time System Design
- Media & Content Delivery
- Async & Data Processing
- Payments & Marketplace
- Distributed Infrastructure

These questions and answers form the base knowledge library -- they are the foundation of our system design preparation. As a beginner in this domain, I'll treat these as the minimum I need to master. 
Once I'm confident with these, I will start expanding ourward: using structured agendas, exploring variations of the same question, and practicing common English expressions used during interviews. 

Eventually, this base knowledge will help me answer more open-ended and FAANG-style system design questions -- but no matter how far I expand, I'll always com back to the base questions. They are the anchor of my learning.
